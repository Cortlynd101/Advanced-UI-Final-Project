# Advanced-UI-Final-Project

## For this project I wanted to do a website that allows you to look at movie listings for a large movie theatre.
   - It also allows you to purchase tickets and snacks before heading to the theatre.
   - Tickets can be purchased in specifc show rooms and specific seats can be purchased from a UI that allows the user to see which tickets have already been taken.
   - Allows them to select the tickets they want before purchase.
   - Tickets and purchased snacks would then be sent to the email of the person who purchased them (or put on a page where they can view their QR codes).
   - They can redeem their QR codes when they show up to the theatre.
## I will be doing this project individually.
## Feature List:
   - The website will need a front page that displays the movies that are currently in the theatre.
   - There will be a page that shows upcoming movies.
   - There will be a page that allows the user to view details of any movie they select.
   - There will be a page that allows the user to purchase snacks before the movie.
   - There will be a page that allows the user to buy specific tickets from an interactive UI that shows all the tickets in the show room they've selected.
   - The showroom will need a database that keeps track of movies and when they're in the theatre.
   - It keeps track of user accounts for the purpose of allowing users to purchase tickets and snacks.
   - The database will need to keep track of which tickets have been purchased.
   - It will also need the ability to send emails to users when they buy tickets/snacks that include redeemable QR codes (or it will be a page where they can view their QR codes).
## Things I will need to accomplish:
   - I always end up creating very sterile websites when I make them for projects, so I wanted to make one that is a little more fun for once.
   - For this website I would need to do that, since movie theatres almost always go for a more upbeat "popcorn" kind of vibe. That would be an interesting new challenge.
   - I would also need to create an interactive UI to showcase the seats that are available in a theatre, which would have to be more difficult than any UI I've made in the past.
   - Lastly, I would also have to send emails to users when they purchase tickets/snacks as well as generate QR codes which isn't something I've done using React before.
